# lab-server

In this, you'll be continuing to explore how clients and servers work. In lab-http, you experienced coding your own client that interfaced with a server (Riddle). In this lab, you will be doing the opposite. 

# Running the server

To run your server, run `bash run.py`. You must run your server first before you run your client.
To rin your client, run `python3 client.py`

# Testing

To test your code, you may run `test_lab.py`. `test_lab.py` will run a server automatically for you. However, you will need to close the server you are running first before running `test_lab.py` otherwise, testing will most likely fail.
